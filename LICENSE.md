Hey there! I'm thrilled to share my Data Science & Analytics internship projects with you. This LICENSE.md file explains how you can use the code, dashboards, and reports in this repository. I‚Äôve chosen the MIT License because it‚Äôs simple and lets you use my work while giving me credit. Here‚Äôs the deal:

Notes on Datasets
This repository uses datasets from Kaggle:

Task 1: Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist
Task 2: Facebook Ad Campaign Dataset
Task 3: Telco Customer Churn Dataset

These datasets have their own licenses on Kaggle, so check their terms before using them. My code and deliverables are covered by the MIT License above.
Thanks for checking out my projects! If you have questions or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out. üòä
