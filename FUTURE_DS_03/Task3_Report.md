# Student Course Feedback Analysis Report

## Introduction
I'm thrilled to share my work on Task 3 of my Data Science & Analytics internship! ðŸŽ‰ I dove into the `student_feedback.csv` dataset to analyze feedback from 1,000 students on college courses, focusing on ratings like professor knowledge and course support. I implemented the complete analysis in `task3_model.py`, creating awesome visualizations to showcase my findings. This report sums up my insights and recommendationsâ€”let's check out what I discovered!

## Data Overview
The dataset gave me a clear view of student opinions on their courses:
* **Customer Attributes**: Student ID.
* **Course Aspects**: Well versed with the subject, Explains concepts in an understandable way, Use of presentations, Degree of difficulty of assignments, Solves doubts willingly, Structuring of the course, Provides support for students going above and beyond, Course recommendation based on relevance.

## Methodology
Here's how I tackled this analysis:
1. **Data Cleaning**: I loaded `student_feedback.csv` using Python, converted ratings to numbers, and filled missing values with the average for each aspect in my `task3_model.py` script.
2. **Metrics Calculation**: I calculated average ratings per aspect, overall ratings per student, and correlations between aspects, all implemented in the Python script.
3. **Visualization**: I created vibrant visualsâ€”a bar chart for average ratings, a heatmap for correlations, and a scatter plot for key aspects vs. overall ratingsâ€”using matplotlib and seaborn in my code.
4. **Analysis**: I identified top and bottom courses to highlight strengths and areas for growth.

## Key Findings
My analysis uncovered some powerful insights:
* **Course Performance**: Courses for Student IDs 999, 1000, and 996 stood out with top overall ratings, while IDs 0, 9, and 6 lagged behindâ€”let's figure out why!
* **Student Feedback**: Professors shine with a 7.50/10 for subject knowledge, but support for go-getters is at 5.66/10. Assignments feel moderately tough at 5.43/10.
* **Connections**: There's a strong link (0.75) between how well professors know their subject and how clearly they explain itâ€”pretty neat!
* **Aspect Trends**: Presentations score 5.94/10, and course structure is at 5.64/10, both showing room to grow.

## Visualizations
My visuals bring the data to life:
* **Average Ratings by Aspect**: A bar chart highlighting the 7.50/10 for subject knowledge and the 5.66/10 for support (see `avg_ratings_bar.png`).
* **Correlation Heatmap**: A colorful map showcasing the 0.75 correlation between knowledge and clarity (see `correlation_heatmap.png`).
* **Subject Knowledge vs. Explanation Clarity**: A scatter plot connecting these aspects with overall ratings as colors (see `scatter_subject_explanation.png`).

## Recommendations
Here's how I'd take these courses to the next level:
1. **Boost Support**: I'd enhance the 5.66/10 for extra helpâ€”let's give eager learners more support!
2. **Balance Assignments**: I'd tweak the 5.43/10 difficulty to keep it challenging yet fair.
3. **Add More Visuals**: I'd jazz up presentations with a 5.94/10 scoreâ€”students want more slides!
4. **Polish Structure**: I'd reorganize the 5.64/10 course flow to improve the experience.

## Technical Implementation
The complete analysis is implemented in `task3_model.py`, which includes:
* Data loading and preprocessing functions
* Statistical analysis and correlation calculations
* Visualization generation using matplotlib and seaborn
* Results export functionality
* Modular code structure for easy replication and modification

## Conclusion
I'm proud to say that courses like those for Student IDs 999, 1000, and 996 are killing it, especially with that 7.50/10 for subject knowledge. My Python implementation in `task3_model.py` and generated visuals (saved in `processed_course_feedback.csv` and PNG files) make these insights shine, and my recommendations are set to boost student satisfaction (submitted by the deadline of 07:00 PM EAT on July 27, 2025). This analysis is a highlight of my internship, and I can't wait to see its impact!
