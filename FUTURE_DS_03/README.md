# Task 3: Student Course Feedback Analysis

## Overview
This project creates an insightful analysis of student feedback on college courses using Google Colab. With the `student_feedback.csv` dataset, I explored ratings on aspects like professor knowledge and course structure to uncover trends and suggest improvements - perfect for making learning better for everyone!

## Business Problem
Understanding student satisfaction is key to improving college courses. This analysis tackles big questions:  

- Which courses are students loving (or struggling with)?  
- How do teaching skills and support connect to overall ratings?  
- What can we tweak to boost the learning experience?

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Student_Feedback Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/student-feedback-survey-responses)
- **Description**: A rich dataset with feedback from 1,000 students, packed with ratings on various course aspects.  
- **Key Columns**: Student ID, Well versed with the subject, Explains concepts in an understandable way, Use of presentations, etc.  
- **Why Chosen**: It's a goldmine of real student opinions, giving us plenty to work with!

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline
```python
# Key transformations performed in Google Colab:
- Load and clean student feedback data
- Convert ratings to numbers and fill missing values with averages
- Calculate overall ratings per course
- Compute correlations between aspects
- Export results for further analysis
```

### Key Metrics Calculated

- **Average Ratings**: Mean scores for each course aspect (e.g., 7.50/10 for subject knowledge).  
- **Overall Rating**: Average across aspects per student.  
- **Correlation Insights**: How aspects like teaching and support relate.

## Key Insights Discovered

### Course Performance

- **Top Courses**: Student IDs 999, 1000, and 996 are standouts—let's learn from them!  
- **Struggling Courses**: IDs 0, 9, and 6 need some TLC to improve.  
- **Aspect Analysis**: A solid 0.75 correlation between subject knowledge and explanation clarity caught my eye!

### Business Recommendations

- **Boost Support**: I'd enhance the 5.66/10 for extra help—let's support eager learners more!  
- **Balance Assignments**: I'd tweak the 5.43/10 difficulty to keep it challenging yet fair.  
- **Add Visuals**: I'd jazz up presentations with a 5.94/10 score—students want more slides!

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required software
- Google Colab (free)
- Git

# Python dependencies (installable in Colab)
!pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
```

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Data-Science-Analytics-Internship.git
   cd Data-Science-Analytics-Internship/FUTURE_DS_03
   ```

2. **Download the dataset**
   - Use the provided `student_feedback.csv` from the internship.

3. **Run analysis**
   - **Option A - Google Colab**: Upload `student_feedback.csv` to `/content/drive/MyDrive/` in Colab and copy the code from `task3_model.py`.
   - **Option B - Local Python**: Run `python task3_model.py` directly (ensure `student_feedback.csv` is in the same directory).
   - The script will generate `processed_course_feedback.csv` and PNG visualization files.

## Dashboard Features

### Interactive Visualizations

- **Average Ratings**: Bar chart showing how each aspect scores.  
- **Correlation Heatmap**: A colorful map of how aspects connect.  
- **Scatter Plot**: Explores subject knowledge vs. explanation clarity with overall rating colors.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Python Programming**: Complete analysis implementation in `task3_model.py`.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming student feedback data.  
- **Analytics**: Calculating averages and correlations for deep insights.  
- **Visualization**: Crafting clear charts with seaborn and matplotlib.  
- **Pandas**: Using pandas for data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Business Intelligence**: Turning data into practical recommendations.

## Results Impact
This analysis helps educators:  

- Spot top-performing and struggling courses.  
- Understand what students value most.  
- Make informed decisions to enhance teaching and support.

## Future Enhancements

- **Student Surveys**: Add more detailed feedback questions.  
- **Trend Analysis**: Track ratings over multiple semesters.  
- **Predictive Insights**: Guess which courses might improve with changes.  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Build a Power BI version for real-time exploration.
