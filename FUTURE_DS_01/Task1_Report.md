# E-commerce Sales Performance Report

## Introduction
I’m thrilled to share my analysis for Task 1 of my Data Science & Analytics internship! 🎉 I dove into our e-commerce sales data from 2016 to 2018, uncovering critical patterns that show where we’re succeeding and where we can grow. My work highlights a solid foundation with huge potential for optimization, and I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to bring these insights to life. Let’s explore what I found and how we can boost our performance!

## Data Overview
The dataset gives a clear picture of our e-commerce operations over three years:
- **Sales Data**: Monthly sales revenue from July 2016 to July 2018.
- **Product Categories**: Over 20 categories, including “beleza_saude” (Health & Beauty), “bebidas” (Beverages), “utilidades_domesticas” (Household Goods), “informatica_acessorios” (Computer Accessories), and “moveis_decoracao” (Furniture & Decor).
- **Product Performance**: Revenue contributions from individual products, with a focus on top performers.

## Methodology
Here’s how I tackled this analysis:
1. **Data Cleaning**: I loaded the e-commerce sales data into Microsoft Power BI Desktop, ensuring consistent formats for dates and revenue values. I removed duplicates and handled missing data to ensure accuracy.
2. **Metrics Calculation**: I calculated total revenue, month-over-month growth (~25%), and category market share. I also analyzed product-level revenue to identify top performers.
3. **Visualization**: I created engaging visuals—bar charts for product performance, line graphs for sales trends, and pie charts for category distribution—all integrated into my Power BI dashboard.
4. **Dashboard**: I built `Ecommerce_Dashboard.pbix` with interactive filters for categories and time periods, plus a mobile-responsive design for easy access.

## Key Findings
My analysis revealed some game-changing insights:
- **Revenue Concentration**: My top 10 products drive 65% of total revenue, with “bebidas” leading at ~0.6M, followed by “beleza_saude” and “brinquedos”. But there’s a 75% revenue gap between the top performer and the 10th-ranked product (0.35M), signaling a dependency risk.
- **Growth Trajectory**: I tracked sales from 0.5M in July 2016 to 2.5M in July 2018, achieving ~25% month-over-month growth. This steady climb shows strong operational strategies.
- **Category Performance**: “Beleza_saude” leads with 15% of revenue, followed by “bebidas” at 12% and “utilidades_domesticas” at 10%. My analysis of 20+ categories highlights a balanced market presence, with growth potential in “informatica_acessorios” and “moveis_decoracao”.
- **Sales Trends**: I found consistent growth with no major seasonal spikes, suggesting stable demand or effective inventory management.

## Visualizations
My visuals make the data pop:
- **Product Performance**: A bar chart showing “bebidas” as the top performer and the revenue gap to lower-ranked products (see `product_performance_plot.png`).
- **Sales Trend**: A line graph tracking steady growth from 0.5M to 2.5M over 2016–2018 (see `sales_trend_plot.png`).
- **Category Distribution**: A pie chart highlighting “beleza_saude” (15%), “bebidas” (12%), and “utilidades_domesticas” (10%) (see `category_distribution_plot.png`).

## Recommendations
Here’s how I plan to take our e-commerce game to the next level:
1. **Immediate Actions (30 Days)**:
   - Optimize inventory by implementing automated reordering for my top 10 products to avoid stockouts.
   - Shift 40% of our advertising budget to promote “beleza_saude” and “bebidas”.
   - Analyze underperforming categories to identify quick wins.
2. **Medium-Term Strategy (6 Months)**:
   - Introduce 2–3 new products in high-performing categories like “bebidas”.
   - Expand market reach using my proven 2018 strategies.
   - Implement real-time dashboard updates for faster decision-making.
3. **Long-Term Vision (12 Months)**:
   - Explore 2–3 new categories to diversify our portfolio.
   - Establish leadership in “beleza_saude” and “bebidas”.
   - Build competitive advantages through broader product offerings.

## Conclusion
I’m proud to say my analysis shows our e-commerce operation has a strong foundation, with consistent 25% month-over-month growth and a diversified category presence. While 65% of revenue comes from just 10 products, I’ve identified opportunities to reduce this risk through diversification and targeted marketing. My Power BI dashboard (`Ecommerce_Dashboard.pbix`) provides an interactive way to monitor progress, and my recommendations—inventory optimization, marketing focus, and category expansion—are set to drive sustainable growth. This analysis is a highlight of my internship, and I’m excited to see its impact in the coming quarters!
